            College life is altogether an adventure , a bunch of memories u cherish for lifetime.It's the best part of everyone's life ,
            it's actually difficult to describe my college life in a small part here but I will try my best.
             I studied in Lovely Professional University ,honestly those were the best days of my life.
              I made some amazing friends and had some amazing experiences. Excitement at its peak ,new place ,new people 
              and most importantly finally freedom from school uniform, haha ( u can try new fashion daily ).
               College life is about mostly all those boring lectures you feel sleepy but still try your best to 
               let the teacher feel you are attentive in class .( Y ,did I spoil my sleep for this lecture ).
                While some students are busy gossiping about what the teacher is teaching and relating it with all 
                types of stupid things and laughing. You will get a lot of opportunity in Lovely professional University.
                There are numerous activities to do depends upon one's choice and interests. Next comes everyone’s favorite area of college ,
                any guesses ? ,Yup it's the college canteen ,where at least my college provides tasty food and filled with a lot of gossips 
                about professors ,classmates and a lot more .( Sorry professors but we all love u so much that we just give u all names 
                :-)But we are nothing without u all. The next best part of college life are the One India,One World,YouthVibe,Coke Studio, 
                everyone of us wait for the entire year for all the cultural ,tech and other fests where we get a platform to meet new people
                 and explore our talents and face the competitive world .it's the best day of the year ( everyone dresses up so well :-)
                  Partying all night long, whenever it is friends B’day. There is no way, anybody could stop us from that now.
                   The whole floor comes up into your room to party hard! At home we are used to eating the things we like but in 
                   a hostel we have to eat whatever we are provided. It may not be tasty or even very hygienic but we don’t have a choice.
                    In LPU,Students of various communities and religion, stay together in a hostel. Thus helps them to know about the various
                    cultures of different regions. They develop a sense of unity in diversity and broaden their outlook. Thy learn the lesson
                    of co-operation. There is one Division named Division of Student where you can register for dance,Music,sports etc.
                  !There is a mall in the campus itself where you can shop, eat, play games, etc. There is a gym as well.
                     The campus itself is too big to accommodate all kind of leisure activities. I am sure many more things have been added till 
                     now. Last but not the least ,group of friends that u can cherish for life ,who stay by your side in everything from getting
                      scolded from professor to completing assignments and journals in the end ,to planning all dangerous pranks
                       , friends are the craziest ,funny and extremely caring among all . Remember,I used to go to Campus cafe,where
                        there was a lot of option to eat.you can enjoy rice bowl,pizza,Dosa etc. All the day outs
                         ,movies ,canteen gossips , healthy flirting and fighting ,all those crazy pet names that they give you, 
                         gossip about professors ,to seniors ,to playing games together ,sharing tiffins sorry not sharing
                          ,taking the entire tiffin and saying ( tu mera bhai hai na yaar ! ) and yes the endless number
                           of selfies and candids ,they have all of your funniest pictures they can blackmail you with
                           ( be safe lol !) . This is my college life ,and I am still living it ,I have pretty much covered everything.
                            Thanks!</p>
